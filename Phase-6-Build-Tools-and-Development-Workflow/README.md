# Phase 6: Build Tools and Development Workflow

## Overview
This phase covers modern build tools, comprehensive testing strategies, and professional development workflows essential for maintaining large-scale property management platforms. Focus on automation, quality assurance, and sustainable development practices.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this phase, you will be able to:
- Configure advanced build systems with Vite for optimal development and production performance
- Implement comprehensive testing strategies covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
- Create automated documentation systems for APIs, components, and user workflows
- Establish maintainable code architecture with clear documentation patterns
- Set up continuous integration and quality assurance processes

## Modules

### [Module 6.1: Modern Build Tools](./Module-6.1-Modern-Build-Tools.md)
**Vite Configuration and Development Optimization**
- Advanced Vite configuration for property applications
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for complex components
- Proxy configuration for government API integration
- Bundle optimization and code splitting strategies
- Development workflow automation

### [Module 6.2: Testing Infrastructure](./Module-6.2-Testing-Infrastructure.md)
**Comprehensive Testing Strategies**
- Unit testing for property calculations and components
- Integration testing for government API integrations
- End-to-end testing for complex property workflows
- Visual regression testing for mapping components
- Performance testing for large property datasets

### [Module 6.3: Documentation and Maintenance](./Module-6.3-Documentation-and-Maintenance.md)
**Documentation Systems and Code Maintenance**
- API documentation with OpenAPI specifications
- Component documentation with TSDoc
- User guides for complex property workflows
- Automated changelog generation and release management
- Code review and maintenance processes

## Real-World Applications
Throughout this phase, you'll work with:
- **Build Optimization**: Efficient development and production builds for complex property applications
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing of financial calculations and user workflows
- **Documentation Systems**: API and user documentation for property analysis tools
- **Maintenance Automation**: Automated processes for code quality and release management

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript and React (Phases 1-2)
- Knowledge of Node.js and npm package management
- Familiarity with version control systems (Git)
- Basic understanding of testing concepts

## Key Technologies
- **Vite**: Modern build tool with fast development and optimized production builds
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework with TypeScript support
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing for complex user workflows
- **TypeDoc**: Automated documentation generation from TypeScript code
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting tools

## Assessment Projects
1. **Build System Configuration**: Set up complete Vite configuration with proxy and optimization
2. **Testing Suite Implementation**: Create comprehensive test suite for property analysis features
3. **Documentation System**: Build automated documentation generation for API and components
4. **Quality Automation**: Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and quality checks
