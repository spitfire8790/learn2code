## Introduction

Property analysis applications require sophisticated user interfaces that can handle complex workflows, large amounts of data, and intuitive user interactions. This module focuses on advanced UI patterns that enhance user experience whilst maintaining performance and accessibility.

Modern property platforms need to support diverse user workflows: from simple property browsing to complex analysis configurations, bulk operations, and collaborative editing. The UI patterns covered in this module address these requirements through carefully designed interaction models and component architectures.

## Section 1: Complex Interactive Components

### Understanding Component Composition Patterns

When building property management interfaces, you'll often need components that work together seamlessly whilst remaining independently maintainable. The key is understanding when to use different composition patterns.

**Compound Components** are ideal when you have a set of components that work together but need flexibility in how they're arranged. For example, a property card system where you might want different layouts for list view versus grid view, but the same underlying functionality.

The compound component pattern allows consumers to compose functionality whilst the parent component manages shared state. This is particularly powerful for property cards where you might need different combinations of:
- Basic property information
- Financial details
- Planning information
- Action buttons
- Selection controls

**Why this matters**: Instead of creating multiple rigid component variants, you create a flexible system that can adapt to different use cases whilst maintaining consistency.

### Render Props and Function Children

Render props become valuable when you need to share complex logic across different visual presentations. In property applications, this is common when displaying the same data in different formats - charts, tables, maps, or cards.

For example, property filtering logic might be complex (handling multiple criteria, real-time updates, caching) but need to render differently in various contexts:
- A sidebar filter panel
- A modal overlay for advanced filtering
- A compact inline filter bar
- A mobile-optimised bottom sheet

The render prop pattern allows you to:
1. Centralise the complex filtering logic
2. Provide a clean interface for consuming components
3. Support multiple visual presentations
4. Maintain testability by separating logic from presentation

**Implementation concept**: Create a component that handles all the filtering logic and provides data and actions through a render prop. This keeps your UI components focused on presentation whilst ensuring consistent behaviour across different interfaces.

### State Management in Complex Components

Complex interactive components often need to manage multiple types of state:
- **UI State**: What's currently visible, selected, or active
- **Data State**: The actual property information being displayed
- **Interaction State**: Temporary states during user actions
- **Synchronisation State**: Keeping UI in sync with external data

**Local vs Lifted State**: Property forms exemplify the decision between local and lifted state. Basic field values might be local, but validation errors, submission status, and cross-field dependencies often need to be lifted to a parent component or context.

**Optimising Re-renders**: In property lists with hundreds of items, preventing unnecessary re-renders becomes critical. Use React.memo strategically, implement proper key props, and consider virtualisation for large datasets.

## Section 2: Modal and Dialogue Systems

### Building Flexible Modal Architecture

Property applications frequently need modals for various purposes:
- Property details and editing
- Analysis configuration
- Report generation settings
- Confirmation dialogues
- Image galleries and document viewers

**Modal State Management**: Rather than managing modal state individually, create a centralised modal system that can handle multiple modal types and stack them appropriately. This prevents issues with overlapping modals and provides consistent behaviour.

**Design considerations**:
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Modals should work well across all device sizes
- **Performance**: Large modals with complex content should lazy-load and optimise rendering
- **User Experience**: Clear entry and exit paths, appropriate sizing, and logical information hierarchy

### Dynamic Content Loading

Property modals often need to load additional data when opened. For example, opening a property details modal might trigger:
- Loading high-resolution images
- Fetching recent market data
- Calculating analysis metrics
- Loading related documents

**Strategies for dynamic loading**:
1. **Skeleton Loading**: Show the modal structure immediately with loading placeholders
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Load basic data first, then enhance with additional information
3. **Smart Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to improve perceived performance
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling when data loading fails

### Modal Composition Patterns

Instead of creating monolithic modal components, use composition to build flexible modal systems:

**Base Modal Component**: Handles the fundamental modal behaviour - overlay, positioning, focus management, and keyboard interactions.

**Content Components**: Specialised components for different types of modal content - forms, galleries, confirmation dialogues, etc.

**Action Components**: Reusable components for modal actions - save/cancel buttons, navigation controls, etc.

This approach allows you to mix and match functionality whilst maintaining consistency across your application.

## Section 3: Drag and Drop Interfaces

### Understanding Drag and Drop Use Cases

In property management applications, drag and drop enhances user workflow in several contexts:

**Property Organisation**: 
- Reordering properties in custom lists
- Moving properties between different categories or portfolios
- Bulk selection and organisation

**Report Building**:
- Arranging report sections and content
- Customising dashboard layouts
- Organising property comparisons

**Document Management**:
- Uploading multiple property documents
- Organising files into categories
- Creating document workflows

### Implementing Accessible Drag and Drop

Accessibility is crucial for drag and drop interfaces. Many users cannot use mouse-based dragging, so you need to provide alternative interaction methods:

**Keyboard Navigation**: Implement arrow key navigation and space/enter for selection and movement.

**Screen Reader Support**: Provide clear announcements about drag state, drop targets, and successful operations.

**Touch Support**: Ensure drag and drop works well on touch devices with appropriate visual feedback.

**Fallback Options**: Always provide alternative ways to accomplish the same tasks (context menus, buttons, etc.).

### Performance Considerations

Drag and drop operations can be performance-intensive, especially with large lists of properties:

**Virtual Scrolling**: For long property lists, implement virtual scrolling to maintain performance.

**Debounced Updates**: Avoid updating external state on every drag movement; debounce updates for better performance.

**Visual Feedback**: Use CSS transforms for immediate visual feedback rather than updating component state.

**Optimistic Updates**: Update the UI immediately while performing background data operations.

### Drag and Drop State Management

Managing drag and drop state requires careful consideration:

**Global vs Local State**: Drag operations that affect multiple components need global state management, while simple reordering might use local state.

**Temporary State**: During drag operations, maintain temporary state that can be committed or rolled back based on the drop result.

**Conflict Resolution**: When multiple users might be reordering the same list, implement conflict resolution strategies.

## Section 4: Performance Optimisation for Complex UIs

### Virtual Scrolling and Windowing

Property applications often display large lists that can impact performance. Virtual scrolling renders only visible items, dramatically improving performance:

**When to Use Virtual Scrolling**:
- Property lists with hundreds or thousands of items
- Complex property cards with images and detailed information
- Search results that might return large datasets

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Item height consistency (fixed vs dynamic heights)
- Scroll position preservation during updates
- Keyboard navigation compatibility
- Screen reader accessibility

### Optimising Re-renders

Complex property interfaces can suffer from excessive re-rendering:

**Memoisation Strategies**:
- Use React.memo for expensive component trees
- Implement custom comparison functions for complex props
- Consider useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components

**State Structure Optimisation**:
- Normalise data structures to minimise update scope
- Separate frequently changing state from stable state
- Use context strategically to avoid prop drilling without causing excessive re-renders

**Component Splitting**:
- Break large components into smaller, focused pieces
- Extract stateful logic into custom hooks
- Use component composition to avoid monolithic components

### Image and Asset Optimisation

Property applications are media-heavy, requiring careful asset management:

**Image Loading Strategies**:
- Lazy loading for images below the fold
- Progressive image loading (low quality to high quality)
- Responsive images for different screen sizes
- WebP format with fallbacks for better compression

**Caching and Preloading**:
- Implement intelligent image caching
- Preload critical images for better perceived performance
- Use service workers for offline image caching

## Section 5: Advanced Animation and Transitions

### Meaningful Motion in Property UIs

Animations in property applications should enhance usability rather than just add visual appeal:

**Navigation Transitions**: Help users understand spatial relationships between views (property list to property details).

**State Changes**: Clearly communicate when data is loading, updating, or has changed.

**Interactive Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback for user actions (button presses, form submissions).

**Attention Direction**: Guide user attention to important information or required actions.

### Performance-Conscious Animations

Animations can impact performance, especially on mobile devices:

**CSS vs JavaScript**: Prefer CSS animations for simple transitions; use JavaScript for complex, interactive animations.

**GPU Acceleration**: Use transform and opacity properties for hardware-accelerated animations.

**Animation Budgets**: Limit the number of simultaneous animations and their complexity.

**User Preferences**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion accessibility.

### Micro-interactions

Small, purposeful animations can significantly improve user experience:

**Hover States**: Provide clear feedback when users hover over interactive elements.

**Loading States**: Use skeleton screens and progress indicators to maintain engagement during loading.

**Form Feedback**: Animate form validation messages and success states.

**Data Updates**: Smoothly animate data changes rather than jarring updates.
