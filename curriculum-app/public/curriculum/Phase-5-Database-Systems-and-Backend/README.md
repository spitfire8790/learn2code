# Phase 5: Database Systems and Backend

## Overview
This phase covers comprehensive backend development for property management platforms, including database design, API development, data management, and performance optimization using Supabase and PostgreSQL.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this phase, you will be able to:
- Design and implement scalable database schemas for property data
- Build secure, performant APIs with Supabase Edge Functions
- Manage complex data migrations and transformations
- Implement advanced caching and performance optimization strategies
- Handle real-time collaboration features
- Monitor and optimize database performance

## Modules

### [Module 5.1: Supabase and PostgreSQL](./Module-5.1-Supabase-and-PostgreSQL.md)
**Database Design and Authentication**
- Relational database design for property systems
- JSONB operations for flexible property attributes
- Supabase authentication and Row Level Security
- Advanced PostgreSQL features (PostGIS, full-text search)
- Database triggers and functions

### [Module 5.2: API Development](./Module-5.2-API-Development.md)
**Serverless APIs and Real-time Features**
- RESTful API design patterns for property platforms
- Supabase Edge Functions with TypeScript
- Complex business logic implementation
- Real-time WebSocket subscriptions
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### [Module 5.3: Data Migration and Management](./Module-5.3-Data-Migration-and-Management.md)
**Data Operations and Integrity**
- Database migration strategies and versioning
- Complex data import/export pipelines
- Data validation and transformation
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Data integrity monitoring

### [Module 5.4: Caching and Performance](./Module-5.4-Caching-and-Performance.md)
**Optimization and Scalability**
- Advanced database query optimization
- Multi-level caching with Redis
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Performance monitoring and analysis
- Scaling strategies for large datasets

## Real-World Applications
Throughout this phase, you'll work with:
- **Property Analysis Platform**: Complete backend for property data management
- **Government Data Integration**: APIs for planning and cadastral data
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket implementation for multi-user workflows
- **Performance Optimization**: Handling millions of property records efficiently

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of SQL basics and database concepts
- JavaScript/TypeScript proficiency (Phases 1-2)
- REST API concepts and HTTP methods
- Basic understanding of authentication and authorization

## Key Technologies
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service with PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL**: Advanced relational database features
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and session storage
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless compute with Deno runtime
- **PostGIS**: Spatial data operations and analysis

## Assessment Projects
1. **Property Database Schema**: Design complete multi-tenant property management schema
2. **Analysis API**: Build comprehensive property analysis API with caching
3. **Data Pipeline**: Create automated import/export system for government data
4. **Performance Dashboard**: Implement monitoring and optimization system
