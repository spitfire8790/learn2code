**Drawing plugins**: Enable users to define search areas, mark property boundaries, or create custom annotations for sharing and analysis.

**Routing plugins**: Integrate travel time and distance calculations for property accessibility analysis and commute planning.

**Heat map plugins**: Visualize property market data, pricing trends, or demographic information as continuous surfaces rather than discrete points.

### Custom Control Development

Property applications often require specialized map controls that aren't available in standard mapping libraries:

**Search interfaces**: Custom property search controls that integrate with application databases and provide real-time suggestions and filtering.

**Layer switchers**: Specialized controls for toggling property data layers, market analytics, or environmental information based on user needs.

**Analysis tools**: Custom controls for property comparison, market analysis, or spatial measurement that integrate seamlessly with the mapping interface.

**Export functionality**: Controls that enable users to save map views, generate reports, or share property information through various formats.

## Section 4: Coordinate Systems and Projections

### Understanding Spatial Reference Systems

Accurate property mapping requires understanding how geographic coordinates translate to screen positions:

**Geographic coordinate systems**: Latitude and longitude systems that define positions on the Earth's surface using angular measurements.

**Projected coordinate systems**: Mathematical transformations that convert spherical Earth coordinates to flat map representations with known distortion characteristics.

**Local coordinate systems**: Regional or national coordinate systems optimized for specific geographic areas, often used in government property databases.

**Web Mercator projection**: The standard projection for web mapping that balances global coverage with reasonable accuracy for most property applications.

### Coordinate Transformation in Property Applications

Property data often comes from multiple sources using different coordinate systems, requiring transformation for consistent display:

**Government data integration**: Property records from cadastral databases may use local coordinate systems that require transformation for web display.

**GPS data handling**: Mobile device locations and survey data typically use WGS84 coordinates that need appropriate transformation for map projection.

**Historical data compatibility**: Older property records may use coordinate systems that have been superseded, requiring careful transformation to maintain accuracy.
