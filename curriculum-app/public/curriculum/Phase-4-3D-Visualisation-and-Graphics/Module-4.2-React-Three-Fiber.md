## Introduction

React Three Fiber bridges the gap between React's declarative component model and Three.js's imperative 3D graphics programming. This integration enables property applications to leverage React's component architecture, state management, and ecosystem while creating sophisticated 3D visualizations.

This module explores how React Three Fiber transforms 3D development by bringing React's declarative paradigm to 3D graphics. Instead of imperatively creating and manipulating 3D objects, you'll learn to describe 3D scenes using JSX components that integrate seamlessly with existing React property applications.

Understanding React Three Fiber is essential for building property applications where 3D visualization is tightly integrated with application state, user interactions, and data management workflows that are already built using React patterns.

## Section 1: React Three Fiber Fundamentals

### Declarative 3D Programming

React Three Fiber transforms imperative Three.js code into declarative React components:

**JSX for 3D objects**: Describing 3D scenes using familiar JSX syntax where Three.js objects become React components with props and children.

**Component composition**: Building complex 3D scenes by composing smaller, reusable components that encapsulate specific 3D functionality and behavior.

**Props-driven configuration**: Configuring 3D objects through React props rather than imperative method calls, enabling more predictable and maintainable code.

**React lifecycle integration**: Leveraging React component lifecycle methods and hooks to manage 3D object creation, updates, and cleanup automatically.

**For property applications, declarative 3D programming enables:**
- Seamless integration with existing React property application architectures
- Reusable 3D components that can be shared across different property visualization features
- Predictable state management that synchronizes 3D visualization with application data
- Easier testing and debugging through familiar React development patterns

### Canvas and Scene Setup

React Three Fiber provides React components that replace traditional Three.js scene setup:

**Canvas component**: The root component that creates WebGL context and manages the Three.js renderer with React-appropriate lifecycle management.

**Scene tree composition**: Building 3D scenes through component nesting that reflects the logical structure of property visualization elements.

**Automatic resource management**: React Three Fiber handles Three.js object creation and disposal automatically as components mount and unmount.

**Responsive design integration**: Connecting 3D canvases with React's responsive design patterns and state management for consistent user experience.

### Component Architecture for 3D Property Elements

Property visualization benefits from component-based 3D architecture:

**Building components**: Creating reusable building components that accept property data as props and render appropriate 3D representations.

**Site components**: Developing terrain, landscape, and infrastructure components that provide environmental context for property visualization.

**UI integration**: Seamlessly combining 3D visualization with React UI components for property information, controls, and navigation.

**Layout management**: Managing the relationship between 3D visualization and traditional React layouts in property application interfaces.

### State Management Integration

React Three Fiber enables natural integration with React state management:

**Hook integration**: Using standard React hooks to manage 3D scene state, camera positions, selected properties, and user interactions.

**Context providers**: Sharing 3D visualization state across component trees using React Context for property selection, view modes, and configuration.

**External state libraries**: Integrating with Redux, Zustand, or other state management libraries to synchronize 3D visualization with broader application state.

**Data flow patterns**: Establishing clear data flow patterns between property data, application state, and 3D visualization components.
