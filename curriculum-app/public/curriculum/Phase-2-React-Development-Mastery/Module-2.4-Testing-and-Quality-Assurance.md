## Introduction

Property analysis applications handle critical financial data and business decisions, making quality assurance essential. A comprehensive testing strategy ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and enables confident development of complex features.

Testing property applications presents unique challenges: complex data relationships, external API dependencies, financial calculations, and diverse user workflows. This module covers strategies for building robust test suites that provide confidence whilst remaining maintainable as your application grows.

## Section 1: Testing Strategy and Philosophy

### The Testing Pyramid for Property Applications

The testing pyramid provides a balanced approach to testing different aspects of your property application:

**Unit Tests (Foundation)**: Form the base of your testing strategy. These tests focus on individual functions, hooks, and components in isolation. For property applications, this includes:
- Data transformation functions (address normalisation, financial calculations)
- Custom hooks for property management
- Individual components without complex interactions
- Utility functions for formatting and validation

**Integration Tests (Middle Layer)**: Test how components work together and interact with external systems. Critical for property applications because:
- Property data flows through multiple components
- API integrations affect user workflows
- State management connects various parts of the application
- Form submissions involve multiple validation steps

**End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)**: Test complete user workflows from start to finish. Essential for property applications to verify:
- Property creation and editing workflows
- Report generation processes
- Search and filtering functionality
- Multi-step analysis procedures

**Balance is Key**: Aim for roughly 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% end-to-end tests. This provides comprehensive coverage whilst maintaining test suite performance and reliability.

### Test-Driven Development for Property Features

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is particularly valuable for property applications due to their complexity and the cost of bugs:

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: 
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the desired behaviour
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code whilst keeping tests green

**Benefits for Property Applications**:
- **Financial Accuracy**: TDD helps ensure calculations are correct from the start
- **Requirement Clarity**: Writing tests first clarifies exactly what a feature should do
- **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents breaking existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how features should work

**When to Apply TDD**:
- Complex business logic (yield calculations, market analysis)
- Critical user workflows (property submission, report generation)
- Data validation and transformation
- API integration logic

### Testing in Agile Property Development

Property applications evolve rapidly with changing market conditions and user needs. Your testing strategy must support agile development:

**Continuous Integration**: Every code change should trigger automated tests, ensuring issues are caught early.

**Test Automation**: Manual testing cannot keep pace with rapid development. Automate repetitive testing tasks.

**Living Documentation**: Tests should clearly communicate what the system does, serving as documentation for new team members.

**Feedback Loops**: Fast-running tests provide immediate feedback, enabling rapid iteration on property features.

## Section 2: Unit Testing Strategies

### Testing Custom Hooks

Property applications rely heavily on custom hooks for state management and business logic. Effective testing of these hooks is crucial:

**Isolation Principles**: Test hooks independently from components to ensure reliable, focused tests.

**Testing State Changes**: Verify that hook state updates correctly in response to various inputs and actions.

**Side Effect Testing**: Test API calls, local storage interactions, and other side effects triggered by hooks.

**Error Handling**: Ensure hooks handle error conditions gracefully and provide appropriate feedback.

**Example Scenarios for Property Hooks**:
- Property data fetching with loading states and error handling
- Property filtering with complex criteria
- Form state management with validation
- Real-time data synchronisation

### Component Testing Approaches

Property components often involve complex interactions and state management:

**Shallow vs Deep Testing**: 
- **Shallow**: Test component logic without rendering child components
- **Deep**: Test component behaviour within its full context

**Props and State Testing**: Verify components respond correctly to prop changes and manage internal state appropriately.

**User Interaction Testing**: Test how components respond to user actions like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard navigation.

**Accessibility Testing**: Ensure components work correctly with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

**Visual Regression Testing**: Detect unintended visual changes, particularly important for property card layouts and dashboard displays.

### Testing Business Logic

Property applications contain significant business logic that must be thoroughly tested:

**Financial Calculations**: 
- Yield calculations with various scenarios
- Market value estimations
- Cost analysis computations
- Return on investment calculations

**Data Validation**:
- Property data format validation
- Business rule enforcement
- Cross-field validation logic
- Data consistency checks

**Property Analysis Logic**:
- Comparison algorithms
- Market trend analysis
- Risk assessment calculations
- Feasibility analysis

**Testing Strategies**:
- Use property data fixtures that represent real-world scenarios
- Test edge cases (zero values, negative numbers, extremely large properties)
- Verify calculations with known correct results
- Test with various property types and market conditions

## Section 3: Integration Testing

### Component Integration Testing

Property applications involve complex component relationships that require integration testing:

**Parent-Child Communication**: Test how property data flows between parent containers and child presentation components.

**Context Integration**: Verify components work correctly with React Context providers for property state, user authentication, and UI settings.

**Form Integration**: Test complete form workflows including validation, submission, and error handling.

**Modal and Navigation Integration**: Ensure modals, routing, and navigation work together seamlessly.

**Key Integration Points**:
- Property list components with filtering and sorting
- Property detail views with related data loading
- Form components with validation and submission
- Search components with result display

### API Integration Testing

Property applications depend heavily on external APIs and services:

**Mock vs Real APIs**: 
- **Development**: Use mocks for fast, reliable tests
- **Staging**: Test against real APIs to catch integration issues
- **Production**: Monitor API integration with automated tests

**Testing Strategies**:
- Mock API responses for various scenarios (success, error, empty results)
- Test error handling and retry logic
- Verify data transformation between API format and application format
- Test authentication and authorisation flows

**Critical API Scenarios**:
- Property data CRUD operations
- Search and filtering requests
- Market data integration
- Report generation services
- File upload and management

### State Management Integration

Complex property applications require robust state management testing:

**Context and Reducer Testing**: Verify state changes occur correctly in response to actions.

**Cross-Component State Sharing**: Test that state updates in one component correctly affect other components.

**Persistence Testing**: Verify state is correctly saved to and restored from local storage or other persistence mechanisms.

**Real-time Updates**: Test WebSocket integration and real-time state synchronisation.

## Section 4: End-to-End Testing

### Critical User Workflows

End-to-end tests should focus on the most important user journeys in property applications:

**Property Management Workflows**:
- Creating a new property with complete information
- Editing existing property details
- Bulk operations on multiple properties
- Property search and filtering

**Analysis Workflows**:
- Running property analysis with various parameters
- Comparing multiple properties
- Generating and downloading reports
- Saving and sharing analysis results

**User Account Workflows**:
- Registration and login processes
- Profile management
- Permission and access control
- Data export and backup

### Browser and Device Testing

Property applications serve diverse users across various platforms:

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent functionality.

**Mobile Responsiveness**: Property professionals often work on mobile devices, requiring thorough mobile testing.

**Performance Testing**: Verify application performance with large datasets and complex property calculations.

**Accessibility Testing**: Ensure the application works with assistive technologies and meets accessibility standards.

### Data Management in E2E Tests

End-to-end tests require careful data management:

**Test Data Strategy**:
- Create realistic property data sets for testing
- Maintain consistent test data across test runs
- Clean up test data to avoid interference between tests
- Use data factories to generate test properties with various characteristics

**Database State Management**:
- Reset database to known state before each test suite
- Use transactions or snapshots for fast cleanup
- Maintain separate test databases to avoid affecting development data

## Section 5: Code Quality and Automation

### Static Analysis and Linting

Automated code quality tools catch issues before they reach production:

**ESLint Configuration**: Set up comprehensive ESLint rules for React, TypeScript, and accessibility. Property applications benefit from strict linting due to their complexity.

**TypeScript Integration**: Leverage TypeScript's type checking to catch type-related errors early.

**Code Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting across the team.

**Import Organisation**: Implement rules for import sorting and organisation to maintain clean, readable code.

**Custom Rules**: Create custom ESLint rules for property-specific patterns and conventions.

### Pre-commit Hooks and CI/CD

Automate quality checks to maintain high standards:

**Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linting, formatting, and basic tests before allowing commits. This prevents low-quality code from entering the repository.

**Continuous Integration**: Set up CI pipelines that run comprehensive test suites on every pull request.

**Code Coverage**: Monitor test coverage and enforce minimum coverage thresholds for critical property logic.

**Performance Budgets**: Set limits on bundle size and performance metrics to maintain application speed.

**Automated Deployment**: Deploy to staging environments automatically for integration testing.

### Code Review and Quality Standards

Human oversight remains essential for maintaining code quality:

**Review Guidelines**: Establish clear guidelines for code reviews, focusing on:
- Property logic correctness
- Test coverage adequacy
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Accessibility compliance

**Team Standards**: Define coding standards specific to property application development:
- Naming conventions for property-related entities
- Error handling patterns
- API integration standards
- Component organisation principles

**Knowledge Sharing**: Use code reviews as learning opportunities to share knowledge about property domain concepts and technical best practices.

### Performance Monitoring and Testing

Property applications must maintain good performance as they grow:

**Performance Testing**: Regularly test application performance with realistic property datasets.

**Monitoring Integration**: Implement monitoring to track real-world performance and identify issues.

**Bundle Analysis**: Monitor JavaScript bundle size and optimise for faster loading.

**Database Performance**: Monitor and optimise database queries, particularly important for property search and filtering.

## Section 6: Testing Complex Scenarios
