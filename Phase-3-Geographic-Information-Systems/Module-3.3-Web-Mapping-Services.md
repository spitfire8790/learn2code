## Introduction

Government spatial data services provide the authoritative foundation for property applications: official property boundaries, zoning regulations, infrastructure information, and environmental constraints. However, integrating these services presents unique challenges including authentication requirements, data format variations, and cross-origin restrictions.

This module explores the standards, techniques, and architectural patterns that enable property applications to reliably access and integrate government spatial data. From basic WMS layer integration to complex multi-source data pipelines, these capabilities are essential for applications requiring authoritative spatial information.

Understanding web mapping services is crucial for building property applications that provide accurate, current information while maintaining the performance and reliability users expect from modern web applications.

## Section 1: Web Mapping Service Standards

### Understanding OGC Standards

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) defines standards that enable interoperability between different spatial data systems:

**Web Mapping Service (WMS)**: Provides rendered map images from spatial data, enabling visualization of complex datasets without requiring client-side processing.

**Web Feature Service (WFS)**: Delivers vector spatial data that can be processed, analyzed, and styled on the client side for interactive applications.

**Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)**: Optimizes map delivery through pre-rendered tiles that provide fast access to commonly requested map views.

**Catalogue Service for Web (CSW)**: Enables discovery of available spatial datasets and services, helping identify relevant data sources for property applications.

**For property applications, standards compliance ensures:**
- Reliable access to government spatial data across different jurisdictions
- Consistent data integration patterns that work with multiple data providers
- Future-proof architecture that adapts to evolving government data services
- Interoperability with existing enterprise GIS systems and workflows

### Service Capabilities and Metadata
